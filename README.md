## React Client Application Routes

- Route `/`: it is the entry point of the web application. It renders the `<Welcome />` component, which represents the Home Page, together with the `<Header />` component,  which represents the Navbar. It shows the greetings message and asks the user to choose between the two game modes: demo version or not. 
- Route `/login`: when the user clicks on the login button in the Home Page, they are redirected to this route. It renders the `<LoginForm />` component, which contains the login form the user compiles to log in the web application.
- Route `/start`: it is the preparation page before the game or round begins. It asks the user if they're ready to play and displays a button to start. If the user is not logged in, it also shows the game rules.
- Route `/game`: it is where all rounds take place. It renders the `<NewCard />` and `<ListCards />` components, which show the newly drawn card and the user's current cards respectively, together with the timer.
- Route `/game/result`: it is where the outcome of the game or round is shown (game for logged users, round otherwise), along with the list of cards won during the game or round. It renders the `<ShowResult />` component and gives the possibility to start a new game, in the case of a logged in user, or to return to the home page, in the other case.
- Route `/profile`:  when the logged user clicks on the "Your Game History" button in the Navbar, they are redirected to this route. It renders the `<Profile />` component, which displays the userâ€™s game history with details about each round.
